# Calculator Instructions:

## Buttons.

-Each button has assigned it's respective symbol it uses, simply press the button with the desired symbol and it will appear on the display of the calculator.

### Special Characters.

-The button with the flask is the calculators scientific mode to use more difficult equations and problems. (See WIP section for more information)

-The C button stands for "Clear" and it clears the calculator of all characters on display.

-The del button deletes the last character typed.

-The +/- symbol is to turn the last number typed in into it's opposite, so if it is positive it will turn it negative and vise versa.

-The / is for division, the x is for multiplication, the + is for addition, the - is for subtraction and the . represennts the decimal point.

## How to use.

To use the calculator type in the desired equation and when done press "Equals" or "=" to see the result.

## Things to keep in mind.

Dividing by Zero will show "Infinity".

The square root of negative numbers don't exist.

Using parentesis will change the order in which the equation will be processed.

## WIP

-The scientific mode for the calculator is not yet available for this version and so the button currently does nothing.

-Parenthesis will only display for negative numbers to comply with the rule of operators shouldn't be next to eachother. In the future there may be a button for specifically using paranthesis while complying with the priority rule when doing an operation.

-The square root function is not yet implemented but it is thought out to be in future versions.

## React Implementation

React will be implemented in the calculator and the idea is to redo the code and to create the not yet added functions like the scientific mode of the calculator and the square root functions, etc. The idea for the scientific mode is once the flask button is pressed it will extend the grid of button the the left of the calculator and display the extra functions there.
