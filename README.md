## Workflow

In this repository I will be creating different challenges and adding them to Main and if I wish to add a challenge to main I must create a branch with the name that best represents that challenge and continue on that branch, if I also choose to add to that branch I must create a "Feature" branch in which I will add the changes I want and then make a PR to do a code-review and if everything is clear then the two will merge and same for the branches of the challenges to Main.

```
Main o-------o-----------\----------------------o
                Challenge \-------o-------o----/ ==Merge
                           Feature \--o--/
```

## Contents of branches:

The branches of Main will contain different challenges in which each one will merge with main once completed. Feature branches will contain changes made to challenge branches.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
